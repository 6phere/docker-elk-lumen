* [Sixphere Lumen Archetype](https://github.com/6phere/lumen-api-suite)
* [ELK Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/sebp/elk/)

## Installation

Download this repository and copy and rename .env.example as .env
```
cp .env.example .env
```

## Run

To run composition:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Proxy

We have include a proxy to resolve domain

### Proxy Configuration
To use hosts in machine configure .env files properties APP_ENV, APP_DOMAIN, APP_DOCKER_IP

You can configure manually adding:
```
localapi.docker-sixphere.com 127.0.0.1
localelk.docker-sixphere.com 127.0.0.1
```

Or using next script

#### Windows hosts configure

Execute script
```
./set_hosts.bat
```

## Volumes

A data folder will be created in the host:

* **app** This folder contains the application.
* **mysql** This folder contains MySQL data storage

If you are using Docker Toolbox you should enable the volume /var/www/html/app in the docker container

## Arquitecture

We have a Lumen Application connect to MySQL and ELK

* [Sixphere Lumen Archetype](https://github.com/6phere/lumen-api-suite)
* [ELK Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/sebp/elk/)
* [MySQL](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/)

## Troubleshoting

### I have broken my installation, how can I start again?

* You must remove the containers
* You must delete the content inside data folder that has been created (if exists)

### ERROR: Cannot create container for service nginx-proxy .... is not a valid Windows path

You must execute in Powershell this:

```
$Env:COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1
```
